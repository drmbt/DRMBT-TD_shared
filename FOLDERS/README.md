**FOLDERS** is a simple component that creates folders in the local directory
relative to the project folder.  
Since a number of my components have default locations for externally synced tables, 
extensions etc.,  
I use this to  define and guarantee a consistent local file structure

To modify, customize this component and add any number of folder paramaters to 
the Folders page. 

Any folder that is defined here will be checked for on pulse, and created if it 
doesn't already exist.  

If onCreate is selected, when dropping this into a new project, it will 
automatically create the desire folders.

If onStart is selected, it will check whenever the TDsession that it is in when 
the project is launched.
